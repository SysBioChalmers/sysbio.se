Jens has been [elected into the National Academy of Science](http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/2019-nas-election.html) in the USA. US-NAS is one of the most prestigious academies in the world, and this is a very special recognition reserved only for the very best among scientists. This is a recognition of Jensâ€™ life-long track record of top scientific achievements and pioneering contributions, many of which took place here at Chalmers SysBio. We are therefore all very proud of Jens and extend to him our warmest congratulations.
