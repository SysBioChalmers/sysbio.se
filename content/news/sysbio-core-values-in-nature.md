Nature has just featured a correspondence piece on SysBio core values as an example of actively building a working culture based on mutual cooperation, communication and respect. "Congratulations to our Core Values Team, and all SysBio members for adopting and supporting our core values", says Ivan Mijakovic.

Dina and Jens added: "Desired organizational culture does not occur spontaneously, it is a result of a permanent effort of the leadership and the team. In our case, we have been actively working for more than 10 years to ensure that we create and maintain the diverse culture that we can be proud of."
