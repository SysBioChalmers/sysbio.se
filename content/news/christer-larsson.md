Christer Larsson, a Professor of Microbial Physiology at SysBio, passed away on October 12th. Christer was as a dedicated scientist and a supportive mentor, an inspiring teacher and a manager who led by example. We all went to him with our problems and Christer always had a solution. It usually came garnished with a spark of Christerâ€™s unique brand of humor - one of the many things about him that we will miss. He was the ultimate team player, and to many of us he was a friend. Now it is up to SysBio to remember him, and keep his spirit of team work alive.
