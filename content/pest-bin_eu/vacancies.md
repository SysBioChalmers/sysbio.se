I have a bachelor’s ´degree in biochemistry from the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) (TUM). During my course of study, I got interested in understanding the biological context in which proteins play a role, not individually but as a whole entity; and in particular, how this complex system differs in aberrant and healthy states. This is how I became familiar with mass spectrometry-based proteomics and in that way, how this technique can be used to characterize the proteome under any given circumstance. In 2018 I enrolled in the master’s degree program also in biochemistry with major focus in bio-organic chemistry and immunology at the TUM. During this phase I became very interested about post-translational modifications (PTMs) and their role in the context-dependent plasticity of the proteome. I gained more practical experience in the field of proteomics by joining Prof. Stephan Sieber’s lab where I learned how MS-based Activity Based Protein Profiling (ABPP) can be used to obtain a first insight into certain PTMs and the identification of protein targets of small drug inhibitors. I then wrote my master’s thesis at the group of Prof. Dr. Thomas Carell at the [Ludwig Maximillian’s University](https://www.lmu.de/en/) where, on one hand, I continued to improve my learning in chemical synthesis and, on the other hand, I sought to gain a better understanding of the role the interactome of a Methylcytosine dioxygenase has in DNA demethylation. For the last, I performed different MS-based experiments such as affinity purification-MS and Cross linking-MS. 

**Project title: Proteome dynamics of bacterial pathogens during infection: new drug targets.** 

The PhD project is part of a work package that aims to generate MS proteomics datasets that are more relevant, comprehensive and time-resolved from the perspective of infections. We will use a wide array of computational tools to extract relevant information about mechanism of infection from these proteomics datasets – ultimately leading to identification of new druggable targets.

ESR15 Thomas Vernay

![](img/facepic-thomas-vernay.jpg)

Thomas Vernay is a french "Ecole de l'Inserm" PharmD/PhD fellow.
He graduated from both [Institut Pasteur](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/), Paris in 2018 (MSc in Microbiology) and [University of Rennes 1](https://www.univ-rennes1.fr/) in 2021 (PharmD). His past works mostly involved the study of host-pathogen relationship with an emphasis on gut microbiota and nutrition ([UMR1241 NuMeCan](https://numecan.fr/homepage/), Rennes), genital innate immunity ([Institut Pasteur](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/cellular-biology-of-microbial-infection/), Paris) and bacterial intracellular persistance ([U1230 BRM](https://biochpharma.univ-rennes1.fr/), Rennes). He also have worked in translational research on pharmacology of antibiotics ([U1070 Phar](https://phar.labo.univ-poitiers.fr/), Poitiers) and vaccination remediation ([CHU Pontchaillou](https://www.chu-rennes.fr/), Rennes).
He is currently working as a PhD student at [Naicons Srl](http://naicons.com/), Milano under the supervision of Dr. Stefano Donadio and Pr. Cristina Airoldi from the [University of Milano-Bicocca](https://www.unimib.it/).

**Project title : Discovery of novel antibiotics from microbes**

The aim of his project is to accelerate the discovery of new antibiotics, by characterizing over 8000 Actinomycetes strains from the Naicons library by metabolomic profiling.
Two approaches, using molecular networking and paired -omics tools, will be considered : identification of “talented” strains & systematic analysis of a "rare" genus.
Promising metabolites with antibacterial properties will be targeted for purification, structural elucidation and characterization.
