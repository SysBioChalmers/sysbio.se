# 1.Goteborg University/Sahlgrenska University Hospital

Host for: ESR1

### Recruiting PI: Roger Karlsson

![Roger Karlsson](img/roger_karlsson.jpg)

We are interested in using genomics and proteomics for the identification and characterization of microorganisms. More specifically, we are interested in developing rapid diagnostic tools for infectious diseases, identifying and characterizing pathogens directly in clinical patient samples, by the discovery of unique peptide biomarkers. Benefits of using proteomics-based identification of pathogens, also known as proteotyping, is that not only can the species or even the strain of the pathogen be identified, by direct analysis of a clinical sample, but also traits such as expressed antibiotic resistance and virulence may be identified, without time-consuming culturing steps or multiple analyses steps.

# Chalmers University of Technology

Host for: ESR2, ESR3, ESR14 

**Recruiting PI:** Prof. August Yurgens, Associate Prof. Roland Kádár, Prof. Nina Kann

### Prof. August Yurgens

![August Yurgens](img/august_yurgens.jpg)

[August Yurgens](https://www.chalmers.se/en/staff/Pages/Avgust-Yurgens.aspx) is a Professor of Solid State Physics at the [Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience (MC2)](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/mc2/Pages/default.aspx) of Chalmers University of Technology. His research interest is graphene physics and its  bio- and high-frequency sensor applications. The technological platform is scalable chemical vapor deposition method giving either in-plane- or out-of-plane-aligned graphene sheets. Combined with micro/nano patterning, the technology allows for versatile graphene structures and devices. 

### Associate Prof. Roland Kádár

![Roland Kádár](img/roland_kadar.jpg)

[Kádár’s group](https://www.chalmers.se/en/staff/Pages/roland-kadar.aspx) is focused on the Rheology and processing of soft matter. Understanding flow-field-matter/compositional interactions in relation to fundamental rheological properties is essential for obtaining products with favorable performance. General research activities of interest are: (i) Advanced characterization methods, method development, (ii) Tailoring multifunctional properties in nanostructured materials and (iii) Dynamics of simple and complex fluids for processing applications.

### Prof. Nina Kann

![Nina Kann](img/nina_kann.jpg)

[Nina Kann](https://research.chalmers.se/en/person/kann) is professor in organic chemistry, heading a research group involved in areas such as organometallic chemistry, asymmetric synthesis and green chemistry. Research focus includes method development using reactions catalysed by ruthenium, iron, palladium and enzymes, with applications in the synthesis of foldamers and antivirals. A recent project also looks at the use of biobased precursors for organic synthesis.

**Recruiting PI:** Céline Henry, Hélène Bierne 

### Céline Henry

![Céline Henry](img/celine_henry.jpg)

The Plateforme d'Analyse Protéomique de Paris Sud-Ouest (PAPPSO facility) provides research teams with equipments, skills and expertises in the field of proteomics, to allow them to respond to the most simple questions (identification of proteins from an organism the genome of which is entirely sequenced) as well as to complex questions (protein quantification in complex samples, dynamics of post-translational modifications,…) in the framework of collaborative projects and contracts. PAPPSO is specialized in high throughput proteomics (quantitative analysis of large cohorts of samples) and in the analysis of highly complex samples (métaprotéomics). The platform develops bioinformatics tools that allow the processing of these experiments and provides asistance to users for data interpretation.

### Hélène Bierne 

![Hélène Bierne](img/helene_bierne.jpg)

Our team is exploring the long-term effects of the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes on mammalian hosts. Using microbiology, cellular and molecular biology, genetics and biochemistry techniques, we study how bacteria and host cells reprogram themselves phenotypically, genetically and epigenetically, to allow Listeria to infect and persist in the host over the long term. This research aims to find new ways to detect asymptomatic infections and treat acute infections.
