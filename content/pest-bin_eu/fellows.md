Pedro Aragon has a bachelor’s degree in biochemistry from the [Technical University of Munich ](https://www.tum.de/en/)(TUM). In 2018, he enrolled in the master’s degree program at the TUM, also in biochemistry, with major focus in bio-organic chemistry and immunology. In 2021 Pedro joined the group of Prof. Ivan Mijakovic as a PhD student at DTU Biosustain, The Novo Nordisk Center for Biosustainability, Kongens Lyngby – Denmark, where his current work focuses on deciphering unprecedented antibiotic targets yet lacking resistance strategies based on the context-dependent plasticity of the host-pathogen-proteomes. Using a combination of organic chemistry and Mass Spectrometry-based proteomics, a powerful analytical platform can be generated to approach specific markers for disease relevant to this threat.

**Project title: Proteome dynamics of bacterial pathogens during infection: new drug targets.** 

The PhD project is part of a work package that aims to generate MS proteomics datasets that are more relevant, comprehensive and time-resolved from the perspective of infections. We will use a wide array of computational tools to extract relevant information about mechanism of infection from these proteomics datasets – ultimately leading to identification of new druggable targets.

After finishing his masters he worked for 2 years in a semiconductor company in Austria (EV Group) working on nano-fabrication techniques to realize photonic devices and optical waveguides using nano-imprint lithography for AR/VR applications. Since June 2021 he have joined Quantum device physics laboratory at Chalmers University to pursue his PhD on below mentioned topic under the supervision of Prof.  August Yurgens.

**Project Title: Biosensors based on CVD graphene and non-covalent functionalization.** 

The objectives of his project are to develop cost effective platform for scalable fabrication of graphene biosensors with high specificity and sensitivity. Large-area graphene grown by CVD method will be transferred from the copper catalyst to a plastic carrier and patterned into multiple individual devices. The transfer process will include environmentally friendly technologies allowing for multiple use of the catalyst. Printed electrodes using carbon - or graphene inks will be employed to contact the devices, again avoiding heavy metals in the devices. Device clusters, up to six graphene sensor elements on a single carrier will be functionalized individually, to be able to detect several types of pathogens in a single analyte droplet placed on the sensor. It is expected that a non-covalent functionalization will preserve high sensitivity of graphene to adsorbates.

## 8. CNRS - French National Centre for Scientific Research {#cnrs}

**ESR8 Margaux Demuysere**

![](../img/margaux.jpg)

Margaux Demuysere is a PhD candidate at the CNRS under the supervision of Dr. Christophe Grangeasse, whose research group studies the regulation of S. pneumoniae cell cycle. Before moving to Lyon (FR), she graduated from a BSc and a MSc in Biomedical Sciences, at the University of Namur (BE) and Utrecht university (NL), respectively. During her master, she specialized in microbiology and immunology. She will now benefit from the expertise of Dr. Grangeasse’s team in biochemistry, bacterial genetics, proteomics and cell imaging to study the cell cycle of S. pneumoniae during competence, a genetic differentiation program recognized as the leading force of bacterial adaptation to stresses such as antibiotic treatments.

**Project Title: Coordination and regulation by phosphorylation of genetic transformation and cell division in Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus)**

Despite the availability of vaccines and antibiotic treatments, efforts to control Streptococcus pneumoniae infection are hampered by the great genomic plasticity of S. pneumoniae. Indeed, S. pneumoniae is able to undergo natural transformation, a mechanism allowing the acquisition of new traits, including antibiotic resistance genes, through the uptake and chromosomal integration of exogenous DNA.
Natural transformation is dependent on the induction of competence, a genetic program triggered by various environmental stresses, including antibiotic treatments. The objective of this project is to refine the regulatory networks at play during the induction of competence by using comparative phosphoproteomics, as well as investigate the coordination between transformation and cell division. Ultimately, this could lead to the development of innovative strategies to tackle antibiotic resistance.

**ESR4 Lydia Palaiodimou** 

![](../img/lydia.jpg)

Lydia Palaiodimou has graduated with a BSc Cell and Molecular Biology from Newcastle University (UK) in June 2019. She also holds an MSc Microbiology from Northumbria University (UK) from which she graduated in January 2021. During her MSc thesis, under the supervision of Dr Edward Fox, she addressed the mechanisms of persistence of Listeria species in the food processing environments by using a comparative genomics approach. This work resulted in a publication in the Journal of Applied Microbiology on March 2021. On May 2021, Lydia was recruited as a PhD student at the National Institute of Agricultural Research and Environment (INRAE, Micalis Institute) in affiliation with the University of Paris-Saclay (FR). She is currently working under the supervision of Dr Alessandro Pagliuso and Dr Celine Henry. Her project focuses on the proteomic analysis of L. monocytogenes in the VBNC state both in vitro and in vivo.

**Project Title: The Listeria monocytogenes proteomic switch upon entry into the viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state in vitro and in human cells**

The bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is the agent of listeriosis, one of the most dangerous food-borne diseases. Listeria contamination is essentially detected by classical microbiology tests based on enrichment steps, thus relying on the cultivability of bacteria. However, both extracellular and intracellular Listeria are able to enter a dormant state called VBNC, characterized by loss of bacterial growth in conventional culturing media. Although undetectable, VBNC bacteria maintain their pathogenic potential, thus representing a risk for human and animal health. By applying cutting edge techniques (RNA sequencing and quantitative proteomics), the project aims at defining the physiological markers of VBNC Listeria and providing fundamental knowledge on asymptomatic bacterial infections. This One Health project also intends to develop tools for the detection of silent VBNC Listeria in food, human and animal samples.
