![](../img/emas-1.png)

Ema obtained her master´s degree in Molecular Biotechnology from the Faculty of Food Technology and Biotechnology at University of Zagreb, Croatia. Her master´s thesis concerned metaproteomic and metagenomic studies of gut microbiota. Since then, she has been working with mass spectrometry-based methods to identify and characterize microorganisms.  Ema joined the group of Professor Ivan Mijakovic at DTU Biosustain in 2021 to pursue her PhD in the discovery of diagnostic biomarkers of pathogenic bacteria. In her project she will model the host-pathogen interaction and then use mass spectrometry and bioinformatics to unravel potential pathogen biomarkers.

**Project title:** **Proteome dynamics of bacterial pathogens during infection: biomarkers for diagnostics**

The PhD project is part of a work package focused on identifying surface biomarkers of various clinically relevant pathogens which will be exploited for development of novel biosensors. Pathogenic bacteria will be grown in contact with human cell lines relevant for the infection. Following the infection modeling, mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics will be used in conjunction with surface shaving to detect differentially expressed proteins on the bacterial surface.

**ESR7** **Mohammed Ghalib Enayathullah**

**e-mail:** mghalib@biosustain.dtu.dk

![](../img/ghalib.png)

Ghalib graduated with an Integrated Master’s Degree in Biotechnology (2019) from SASTRA University, India. For his master thesis, Ghalib worked under the guidance of Dr. Gautham B.J., on developing a cost-effective method for lactic-acid production and its techno-economical understanding using simulations. In 2019, he joined Dr. Idris in CSIR-CCMB as a trainee to gain expertise in molecular biology techniques and because he wanted to delve into infection biology. As the COVID-19 hit India in 2020, Ghalib joined a national level Antiviral Drug Screening project with Dr. Kiran Kumar in CSIR-CCMB, gaining extensive experience in virology, cell culture, drug screening, molecular biology for 2 years and he developed a pipeline of proteomics out of self-interest. In 2022, he joined as a PhD student in Technical University of Denmark in Prof. Ivan Mijakovic’s Lab to continue pursuing and widen his understanding of infections as he gains proficiency. Like his mentors he wishes to educate himself and as many researchers and people as possible, but in understanding infection mechanisms to be able to fight against mutating persisters.

**Project title: Proteome dynamics of bacterial pathogens during infection - New Drug Targets**

His project aims at identifying differentially expressed and phosphorylated proteins in bacterial pathogens during an infection, and to validate these as potential new targets for antibiotics. His focus is built on the interaction of infectious pathogenic bacteria on a host system (preferentially human cell lines) and their (phosphor-)proteomes analyzed by quantitative MS proteomics approaches (SILAC, iBAC). Strains will be genetically engineered in which candidate proteins will be either inactivated or transformed into phospho-mimetic or phospho-ablative mutants. The mutant strains will be tested in virulence assays. In cases where impact on virulence will be proven, he will follow up with genetic and biochemical characterization of participation of these proteins in the infection process. He believes he will generate a list of differentially regulated proteins confirmed to be involved in infection – to be used as targets for antibiotics development

**ESR8 Margaux Demuysere**

**e-mail:** margaux.demuysere@ibcp.fr

![](../img/margaux.jpg)

Margaux Demuysere is a PhD candidate at the CNRS under the supervision of Dr. Christophe Grangeasse, whose research group studies the regulation of S. pneumoniae cell cycle. Before moving to Lyon (FR), she graduated from a BSc and a MSc in Biomedical Sciences, at the University of Namur (BE) and Utrecht university (NL), respectively. During her master, she specialized in microbiology and immunology. She will now benefit from the expertise of Dr. Grangeasse’s team in biochemistry, bacterial genetics, proteomics and cell imaging to study the cell cycle of S. pneumoniae during competence, a genetic differentiation program recognized as the leading force of bacterial adaptation to stresses such as antibiotic treatments.

**Project Title: Coordination and regulation by phosphorylation of genetic transformation and cell division in Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus)**

Despite the availability of vaccines and antibiotic treatments, efforts to control Streptococcus pneumoniae infection are hampered by the great genomic plasticity of S. pneumoniae. Indeed, S. pneumoniae is able to undergo natural transformation, a mechanism allowing the acquisition of new traits, including antibiotic resistance genes, through the uptake and chromosomal integration of exogenous DNA.
Natural transformation is dependent on the induction of competence, a genetic program triggered by various environmental stresses, including antibiotic treatments. The objective of this project is to refine the regulatory networks at play during the induction of competence by using comparative phosphoproteomics, as well as investigate the coordination between transformation and cell division. Ultimately, this could lead to the development of innovative strategies to tackle antibiotic resistance.

Lydia Palaiodimou has graduated with a BSc Cell and Molecular Biology from Newcastle University (UK) in June 2019. She also holds an MSc Microbiology from Northumbria University (UK) from which she graduated in January 2021. During her MSc thesis, under the supervision of Dr Edward Fox, she addressed the mechanisms of persistence of Listeria species in the food processing environments by using a comparative genomics approach. This work resulted in a publication in the Journal of Applied Microbiology on March 2021. On May 2021, Lydia was recruited as a PhD student at the National Institute of Agricultural Research and Environment (INRAE, Micalis Institute) in affiliation with the University of Paris-Saclay (FR). She is currently working under the supervision of Dr Alessandro Pagliuso and Dr Celine Henry. Her project focuses on the proteomic analysis of L. monocytogenes in the VBNC state both in vitro and in vivo.

**Project Title: The Listeria monocytogenes proteomic switch upon entry into the viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state in vitro and in human cells**

The bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is the agent of listeriosis, one of the most dangerous food-borne diseases. Listeria contamination is essentially detected by classical microbiology tests based on enrichment steps, thus relying on the cultivability of bacteria. However, both extracellular and intracellular Listeria are able to enter a dormant state called VBNC, characterized by loss of bacterial growth in conventional culturing media. Although undetectable, VBNC bacteria maintain their pathogenic potential, thus representing a risk for human and animal health. By applying cutting edge techniques (RNA sequencing and quantitative proteomics), the project aims at defining the physiological markers of VBNC Listeria and providing fundamental knowledge on asymptomatic bacterial infections. This One Health project also intends to develop tools for the detection of silent VBNC Listeria in food, human and animal samples.
