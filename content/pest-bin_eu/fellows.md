**ESR7 Pedro Aragón Fernández**

![](../img/pedro-dtu.png)

Pedro Aragon has a bachelor’s degree in biochemistry from the [Technical University of Munich ](https://www.tum.de/en/)(TUM). In 2018, he enrolled in the master’s degree program at the TUM, also in biochemistry, with major focus in bio-organic chemistry and immunology. In 2021 Pedro joined the group of Prof. Ivan Mijakovic as a PhD student at DTU Biosustain, The Novo Nordisk Center for Biosustainability, Kongens Lyngby – Denmark, where his current work focuses on deciphering unprecedented antibiotic targets yet lacking resistance strategies based on the context-dependent plasticity of the host-pathogen-proteomes. Using a combination of organic chemistry and Mass Spectrometry-based proteomics, a powerful analytical platform can be generated to approach specific markers for disease relevant to this threat.

**Project title: Proteome dynamics of bacterial pathogens during infection: new drug targets.** 

The PhD project is part of a work package that aims to generate MS proteomics datasets that are more relevant, comprehensive and time-resolved from the perspective of infections. We will use a wide array of computational tools to extract relevant information about mechanism of infection from these proteomics datasets – ultimately leading to identification of new druggable targets.

Maria João Cardoso holds a BSc in Nutritional Sciences and a MSc in Foodservice Management from University of Porto. In 2017, she enrolled in a MSc in Applied Microbiology from the Portuguese Catholic University, which led her to start conducting research in Food Microbiology, studying prevalence, cross contamination events and antibiotic resistance of Campylobacter spp. isolates. In 2019, she joined the European Reference Laboratory for Escherichia coli including VTEC at Istituto Superiore di Sanità, in Rome. During her stay, she followed the activities related with the surveillance and epidemiology of Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome, the most severe form of human Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) infection, and the routine application in place for the diagnosis of human diseases caused by this microorganism. Apart from that, she collaborated in one project focused on the development of a biosensor for personalized medicine, aiming at the detection of the Shiga toxins in stools and serum samples from patients with STEC infections. Maria João is now a PhD student in the PEST-BIN project and is carrying out her research project at the University of the Balearic Islands under the supervision of Professor Margarita Gomila Ribas, with secondments at the University of Gothenburg, under the supervision of Professor Edward Moore, and Nanoxis, under the supervision of Professor Roger Karlsson.

**Thesis title: Role of clinical environment as a reservoir of nosocomial infections**

Maria João’s project will focus on the role of clinical environment as a reservoir of nosocomial infections. The objective will be to identify the microbial composition of clinical environments, characterize the mobile genetic elements associated to virulence and antibiotic resistance as well as to detect new antibiotic resistance genes. The project will provide deep insight into the genomic potential for the metabolic processes, evolutionary relationships, epidemiology and factors associated with the mobilomes and resistomes of pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria.

**ESR15 Thomas Vernay**

![](../img/facepic-thomas-vernay.jpg)

Thomas Vernay is a french "Ecole de l'Inserm" PharmD/PhD fellow.
He graduated from both [Institut Pasteur](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/), Paris in 2018 (MSc in Microbiology) and [University of Rennes 1](https://www.univ-rennes1.fr/) in 2021 (PharmD). His past works mostly involved the study of host-pathogen relationship with an emphasis on gut microbiota and nutrition ([UMR1241 NuMeCan](https://numecan.fr/homepage/), Rennes), genital innate immunity ([Institut Pasteur](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/cellular-biology-of-microbial-infection/), Paris) and bacterial intracellular persistance ([U1230 BRM](https://biochpharma.univ-rennes1.fr/), Rennes). He also have worked in translational research on pharmacology of antibiotics ([U1070 Phar](https://phar.labo.univ-poitiers.fr/), Poitiers) and vaccination remediation ([CHU Pontchaillou](https://www.chu-rennes.fr/), Rennes).
He is currently working as a PhD student at [Naicons Srl](http://naicons.com/), Milano under the supervision of Dr. Stefano Donadio and Pr. Cristina Airoldi from the [University of Milano-Bicocca](https://www.unimib.it/).

**Project title : Discovery of novel antibiotics from microbes**

The aim of his project is to accelerate the discovery of new antibiotics, by characterizing over 8000 Actinomycetes strains from the Naicons library by metabolomic profiling.
Two approaches, using molecular networking and paired -omics tools, will be considered : identification of “talented” strains & systematic analysis of a "rare" genus.
Promising metabolites with antibacterial properties will be targeted for purification, structural elucidation and characterization.
