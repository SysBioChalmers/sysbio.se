**Welcome to the Advanced Course on Metabolic Engineering and Systems Biology!**

This course is organized by the [Systems and Synthetic Biology](http://sysbio.se) division at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/bio/Pages/default.aspx), and is intended for PhD students, postdocs and industrial researchers that are interested in computational aspects of metabolic engineering. The aim of the course is to provide participants with a strong primer of various (computational) aspects of metabolic engineering. The topics addressed range from constraint-based and kinetic modelling of metabolism, metabolic control analysis, synthetic biology tools and integrative omics data analysis. The course is intensive and will require pre-course studying of material that will be provided closer to the start date.

**Setting of the course schedule is in progress and will be finished in the coming weeks.**

# Travel and accommodation

The course will take place at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://goo.gl/maps/N9kmFD6oRpF2), Gothenburg, Sweden.

## Arrival information

**Arriving via Landvetter Airport**  
Taxis are located in front of the airport, with fixed prices for rides into different parts of the city. A taxi ride to Chalmers should cost approximately 450 SEK.

A more economical option is the airport bus (managed by [Flygbussarna](https://www.flygbussarna.se/en/landvetter)) that stops just outside the airport and takes you to Göteborg in about 20 minutes for 119/215 SEK for a single/return ticket (return is valid for 3 months, and tickets are cheaper to buy online). If asked, the bus driver can give you a free 90 min ticket that can be used for onward travel within Gothenburg with [Västtrafik](https://www.vasttrafik.se/en/), the region's public transport system. To make your way to Chalmers, get off the airport bus at Korsvägen, and take tram 6 (Länsmansgården), 8 (Frölunda) or 13 (Sahlgrenska) for a direct connection to Chalmers.

Note: You cannot pay with cash on the airport bus.

**Arriving via Central Station**  
Gothenburg Central train station is located approximately 4 km away from Chalmers. Upon exiting the central station, keep walking straight to locate the tram and bus stop. Tram 13 (Sahlgrenska) and 7 (Tynnered) are direct connections to Chalmers.

The taxi service is located just outside the exit on the left hand side.

**Getting around**  
The public transport in Gothenburg is run by [Västtrafik](https://www.vasttrafik.se/en/), please refer to them for times and schedules.

Note: You cannot pay with cash on public transport, while only trams have machines that accept credit cards!
