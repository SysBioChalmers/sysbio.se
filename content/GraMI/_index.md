GraMI is an Interdisciplinary Research Project funded by NordForsk.  

The main goal of this project is to combat the increasing drug-resistant microbial infections by developing novel methods for sustained delivery of antimicrobials. Specifically, we will be focusing on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which causes devastating intravascular infections.   

Our interdisciplinary team will develop the technology for production of graphene-enhanced nanocomposites and nanoparticles, which will incorporate antimicrobial drugs and ensure efficient and sustained drug delivery at the site of infection.  

This consortium will bring various experts from disciplines in the areas of Physical Sciences and Life Science (physics of 2D materials, nanomaterials science, polymer chemistry, microbiology and biotechnology) under one roof, working together to develop the next generation of antimicrobial drug delivery systems. To accomplish this, we built a Nordic research and innovation hub.
