#### Current research

##### Protein phosphorylation
We are interested in signaling and regulation in bacterial cells, focusing in particular on regulatory phenomena based on protein phosphorylation. Most of our research activities are carried out on _Bacillus subtilis_, a model organism for Firmicutes. _B. subtilis_ is a wonderful model for studying complex signaling circuits in developmental phenomena, since it displays a wide array of “survival” strategies: motility, versatile degradative functions, production of bacteriocins, natural competence, biofilm formation, cannibalism and spore development. Our laboratory specializes in bacterial protein-tyrosine kinases (BY-kinases), serine/threonine kinases of the Hanks-family, phosphoproteomics other “omics” approaches aiming at global studies of the phosphorylation-based regulatory networks in both model and pathogenic bacteria. We are also interested in the evolution of protein kinases and their relationship with substrates.

##### Graphene-based bio-applications
In collaboration with the Chalmers Graphene Centre, we are developing advanced graphene-based antibacterial coatings and graphene-based bio-sensors.

##### Metabolic engineering
We are implementing a wide array of metabolic engineering tools in order to optimize B. subtilis as a cell factory for the production of platform chemicals, industrially relevant enzymes and nanoparticles.

**IMPORTANT NOTE FOR STUDENTS APPLYING FOR INTERNSHIPS**  
Please note that our group does not admit internships/student projects shorter than one semester (5-6 months). Master projects carried out in our laboratory are not remunerated, so international students have to secure their own scholarships before applying.
