In 2018 I started my PhD project on the production of pharmaceutical proteins in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. The Systems and Synthetic Biology Division has a lot of experience in this topic and I will continue on their previous work. The main topic in my PhD project is the production of novel pharmaceutical proteins in our optimized strains where I try find new bottlenecks. At the moment I am looking into the presence of proteases and reactive oxygen species in the cell which have a negative influence on protein production and secretion.
