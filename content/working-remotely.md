This page lists some starter resources to enable remote work within SysBio.

## 1. Connect to the Chalmers network

To access a number of Chalmers and SysBio resources, one needs to be part of the
Chalmers network, either physically or via VPN (virtual private network).

If you have a Chalmers-managed (CDA) computer,
then connecting to the Chalmers VPN should be fairly simple. See IT instructions for your OS:

https://it.portal.chalmers.se/itportal/Faq/VPN

One can create a Chalmers VPN connection from scratch on any modern OS (Linux, Android, iOS, Windows).
See the same link above for setting this up.


## 2. Accessing SysBio group file areas


See instructions here (needs VPN connection): https://sysbiowiki.se/w/Group_file_areas
