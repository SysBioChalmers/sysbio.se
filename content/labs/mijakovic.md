### The Mijakovic lab – who are we and what do we do?

The work in our lab is driven by scientific curiosity: we seek to understand and describe how biology works. We sometimes also modify and engineer biological systems for various purposes useful to the society.

There are currently about 30 team members in the Mijakovic lab, working at two sites: Chalmers (Sweden) and DTU (Denmark), and they come from very diverse scientific and cultural backgrounds. Our lab started out as a microbiology group, but as our ambitions and curiosity grew, we expanded into several other areas of life science, often using interdisciplinary approaches. Today, in addition to general bacteriology, we work with applications of various nanomaterials in biomedicine and biotechnology, metabolic engineering of microbial cell factories and experimental evolution.  

The spirit in which we work together as a team is that of scientific freedom. With that freedom come many responsibilities: to strive for scientific excellence, to guarantee the quality and reproducibility of our results, to always be aware of ethical dimensions of our research and to ensure support for our research, which is financed with external funding from national public research councils and private foundations. 

Another important aspect of working in the Mijakovic lab is the spirit or collaboration. Since we all come from diverse scientific disciplines, we all have a lot to learn from each other. We all help and support each other - our best work is done when we work together.

**IMPORTANT NOTE FOR STUDENTS APPLYING FOR INTERNSHIPS:**

Please note that our group does not admit internships/student projects shorter than one semester (5-6 months). Master projects carried out in our laboratory are not remunerated, so international students have to secure their own scholarships before applying.

**IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING SPONTANEOUS APPLICATIONS FOR PhD POSITIONS:**

Please note that our group cannot accommodate such requests. All our PhD positions are always advertised at the university vacancies website. If you see a position that suits you, please apply via the official channels. If you don’t see any positions, that means we have none currently.
