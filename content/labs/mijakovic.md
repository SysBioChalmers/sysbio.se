**Current research**



* **Protein phosphorylation**

We are interested in signaling and regulation in bacterial cells, focusing in particular on regulatory phenomena based on protein phosphorylation. Most of our research activities are carried out on Bacillus subtilis, a model organism for Firmicutes. B. subtilis is a wonderful model for studying complex signaling circuits in developmental phenomena, since it displays a wide array of “survival” strategies: motility, versatile degradative functions, production of bacteriocins, natural competence, biofilm formation, cannibalism and spore development. Our laboratory specializes in bacterial protein-tyrosine kinases (BY-kinases), serine/threonine kinases of the Hanks-family, phosphoproteomics other “omics” approaches aiming at global studies of the phosphorylation-based regulatory networks in both model and pathogenic bacteria. We are also interested in the evolution of protein kinases and their relationship with substrates.



* **Graphene-based bio-applications**

In collaboration with the Chalmers Graphene Centre, we are developing advanced graphene-based antibacterial coatings and graphene-based bio-sensors.



* **Metabolic engineering**

We are implementing a wide array of metabolic engineering tools in order to optimize B. subtilis as a cell factory for the production of platform chemicals, industrially relevant enzymes and nanoparticles.

**IMPORTANT NOTE FOR STUDENTS APPLYING FOR INTERNSHIPS:**

Please note that our group does not admit internships/student projects shorter than one semester (5-6 months). Master projects carried out in our laboratory are not remunerated, so international students have to secure their own scholarships before applying.
