An overarching goal of our research is to understand **how signalling through the reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide impacts organismal physiology and disease** as well as how such knowledge can be exploited in engineering health and biotechnology. Our research has shown that, despite a wealth of accumulated literature over the years on their detrimental effects, **reactive oxygen species sustain important roles in intracellular signalling**. In line with this, we have shown that a group of anti-oxidant enzymes, **peroxiredoxins, that by far are the most hydrogen peroxide reactive molecules in cells, reduce the incidence of age-related disease by acting as key regulators of aging and proteostasis**. However, their molecular functions are poorly understood. It is therefore imperative to **elucidate the bona fide cellular function(s) of peroxiredoxins**, how they act to slow down aging and reduce the incidence of cancer and other age-related diseases. 

By combining **cutting-edge Molecular Cell Biological, Genetic and Biochemical approaches** and research into the impact of **hydrogen peroxide signalling** on **biotechnology, metabolism** and **proteostasis** we aim to clarify molecular mechanisms of aging and age-related disease and to implement novel knowledge in the engineering of health and biotechnology.
