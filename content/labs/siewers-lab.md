With the help of state-of-the-art synthetic and systems biology technologies, we engineer yeast cells for a vast variety of applications. This includes:

* cell factories for the sustainable production of plant metabolites used as agrochemicals, biofuels, pharmaceuticals or nutraceuticals
* efficient protein producers for the manufacturing of protein drugs
* metabolite sensors to screen for efficient enzyme or pathway variants and to regulate metabolism
* whole-cell biosensors for pathogen detection
