**Current research**

We are interested in understanding and using the dynamic behavior of signal transduction pathways. For this we integrate experimental studies with mathematical modelling and prediction. We use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as experimental organism. Our research has focused on the HOG signaling pathway, that controls adaptation to osmotic stress, and the AMPK/SNF1 pathway, which controls cellular energy homeostasis. In recent years we have increasingly employed studies in single living cells to capture signaling dynamics. Signaling circuits are useful tools for cell engineering and programming and we have demonstrated recently how such circuits can be engineered or reconstructed.
