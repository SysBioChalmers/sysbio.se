Dina Petranovic has a **Msc** (1994-1999) in Molecular Biology from the Faculty of Science and Mathematics, Zagreb University in Croatia, **PhD** (2000-2004) in Molecular Microbiology from Université Paris XI in France, **two postdocs** at Technical University in Denmark (2004-2006, in Microbial Physiology and Genetics, and 2006-2008 in Microbial Biotechnology), and **assistant professorship** (2008-2012), **docent **(2012) and **tenure as associate professor** (since 2013) at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden. During her career Dina has also been **visiting scientist** in Rich Losick's Lab at Harvard in 2006 and **visiting professor** in Susan Lindquist's Lab at MIT in 2012.

Dina is **CEO **of a non-profit organization Molecular Frontiers, which is under the Royal Scwedish Academy of Science, **editor **of FEMS Yeast Research, co-director in the European Federation of Biotechnology and member of several societies (IMES, SBE etc).

Dina is also a **teacher, supervisor and examiner** at Chalmers University in Göteborg and **mentor **at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, and was awarded the **pedagodical prize** at Chalmers in 2013.

During her PhD and postdocs Dina worked with Gram+ bacteria _Lactococcus lactis_ and _Bacillus subtilis_ where she studied transcriptional regulation via the pleiotropic regulator CodY, signal transductions via the phosphorelay PTS-system and protein tyrosin phosphorylation. Since 2007 she became more interested in eukaryal molecular biology and since 2008 has been working with yeast _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ as a model organism, for study of complex cellular processes, such as proteome maintenance, ageing and apoptosis. In her group they are interested in these pathways from the fundamental and applied angle (biotechnology and biomedical research), and they use reductionist and holistic approaches in research (_in vivo_, _in vitro_ and _in silico_) by combining methods of molecular and cell biology, biochemistry, bioinformatics and systems biology (including omics and modeling), with the main scope to study how cells regulate proteostasis stress (proteome homeostasis).
