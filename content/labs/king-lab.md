Our main research focus is on the automation of science. In particular, we are interested in the development of ‘Robot Scientists’: physically implemented computer/robotic systems that utilise techniques from artificial intelligence (AI) to execute cycles of scientific experimentation. We are developing a 3rd Generation Robot Scientist ‘Genesis’ focused on yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) systems biology. The hardware for Genesis will consist of ~10,000 micro-chemostats and associated transcriptome and metabolome measurement instrumentation. The goal for the AI software is to be over a thousand times more efficient than human scientists at executing cycles of scientific experimentation.
