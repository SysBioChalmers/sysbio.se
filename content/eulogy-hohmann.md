### Professor Stefan Hohmann   
#### (08.09.1956-02.07.2021)  

Professor Stefan Hohmann was one of the European pioneers of yeast molecular biology. Trained by one of the founding fathers of yeast genetics and molecular biology, Prof. Zimmermann at University of Darmstadt, Stefan then did a post doc at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven with Prof. Thevelein, another world leader in the field of yeast genetics and molecular biology.

Stefan continued his European journey in Gothenburg, where he influenced yeast and systems biology significantly. In Sweden he received early on a prestigious grant from the Swedish Research Council as Research Professor, and shortly after he was appointed as Professor at Gothenburg University, where he played an instrumental role in gathering a number of young yeast researchers and establish a very strong yeast research environment, impressive both by the breadth and the depth of competences. Even today, more than 25 years after Stefan’s arrival to Gothenburg, we still see a strong and thriving research environment on yeast genetics, molecular biology, systems biology and metabolic engineering, thanks to the seeds of science and leadership that Stefan had planted. 

Stefan’s research was focused on osmotic stress in yeast, and he made many pioneering discoveries on the HOG pathway in yeast. This expanded into general studies on sensing of the environment, and several of his research papers stands out as influential contributions to science. Even though trained as a classical molecular biologist, Stefan was an early pioneer and supporter of systems biology. Stefan was also one of the founding fathers of the Yeast Systems Biology Network, that enabled coordination of new standards as well as it made the foundation of several new research agendas that resulted in significant funding from both the EU and several national governments in Europe. 

Throughout his career Stefan contributed to the scientific community as editor and editorial board member of several journals. He served as Editor in Chief for Current Genetics between 2001 and 2014 and Editor in Chief for Molecular Genetics and Genomics from 2005 until he passed away.

Besides serving his community with science, Stefan also gave his time and talent to serving as a leader. He was for several years Deputy Dean for the Natural Science Faculty at GU and in 2015 he was recruited as Head of Department of Biology and Biological Engineering at Chalmers. During his tenure the department grew, in terms of faculty, international profile, and internal strength. Stefan was a constant visionary, looking ahead on how the department could further strengthen its profile and international standing.

Besides being respected for his science and leadership, Stefan was appreciated for his integrity, humor, love of his family and their animals, love for Africa, good wines and football. In his love for football Stefan showed not only the love of the game but also his caring personality, as a football coach for young boys, a “hobby” that he took greatly to his heart. 
Stefan was a caring, engaged, dedicated and loving person and we will all miss him tremendously, for his science, his leadership, his friendship, his humanity, his humor…

Our feelings and our thoughts go to the entire Hohmann family. We, the yeast and systems biology community of Gothenburg and of the world are here for you.

Professor Jens Nielsen, Chalmers University of Technology
